I have made a website like Student search iitk but i have considered a small database which can be found in script.js file.All the opyions in the site are working but due to small database only certain names and certain hometown can searched on it.for example some of the names that can be searched are:Piyush Singal,Yuvraj Singh,Pradyumna Deshmukh,Kushal,Sahil(you don't have to type the entire name you can even type only first letter also).Similarly some of the hometowns that can be searched are:Hisar,Pune,Mathura,Noida,Patna.For other names and hometown that can be searched on it please refer to script.js file.In the attributes which have selective option(such as:Batch) one of the option can be selected but all options have some data linked to it so you can select anyone option.You have to click search option everytime if it shows nothing or it is showing the previous data that was searched that means no data found related to your search.Also,it would be better if you reload the website after every search.
This website is best suitable for laptop and computer.
You can access the website through this link  [Student Search by Piyush Singal](https://piyushsingal3.github.io.)
